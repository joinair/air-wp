# Development process
We use a staging site for development and to test all changes. Below is a brief summary of the workflow for this project:

  1. Clone this project locally
  2. Create a new branch
  3. Make changes and upload via SFTP to staging site.
  4. View changes on staging site: https://joinair.staging.wpengine.com
  5. When changes are complete, create a new Pull Request
  6. Changes will be reviewed and then everything will be deployed to our production site (theme files, plugins, database changes, etc)
